Search systems:
    - stateless system: produces the same results for every user, regardless of context
    - state system: personalizes results
    Traditional Search System:
        - Like Googe, Bing, etc.
        - keyword box
        - keyword based (originally), now can also type sentences
    Social Media Search Systems:
        - Facebook, Twitter
        - keyword box present
        - user input box, for data
        - data source is different than trad. sys.
    Location, Mobile:
        - Yelp, Google
        - Google provides integration
    Personal:
        - Based on your own data
            things like fitbit
    Ingredients of Search:
        - Data 
        - User ("the most important thing"), they provide the need

    Back End = locator, analyzer/ingestor
    query time operations = query processor, answer retriever, mather/ranker, personalization context, result presenter

Index:
    - logical view of data
    - pointers
    - meta data
        - hints to us how we should handle the data
    -

??:
    - Indexing comes between the data and the need
    - One pass: no work needs to be done before search can be performed
    - Two pass: an index need to be pre-organized and indexed
        - at query only the index is looked at
        - this means there needs to already existing data
    - Semantic Gap
        - what the system provides vs. what user means/needs
        - users think in terms of objects and events
        - there is always a semantic gap, and is a basic problem in search
